# sonic-server
ðŸŽ‰Back end module of sonic client test platform.

# Background
Nowadays, automatic testing, remote control and other technologies have gradually matured. Appium can be said to be the leader in the field of automation, and STF is the ancestor of remote control. A long time ago, I began to have an idea about whether to provide test solutions for all clients (Android, IOS, windows, MAC and web applications) on one platform. Therefore, sonic client test platform was born.

Sonic's vision is to help small and medium-sized enterprises solve the problem of lack of tools and testing means in client automation or remote control. If you want to participate, welcome to join! If you want to support, you can give me a star.

## Background

> Nowadays, automatic testing, remote control and other technologies have gradually matured. [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium) can be said to be the
leader in the field of automation, and [STF](https://github.com/openstf/stf) is the ancestor of remote control. A long time ago, I began to have an idea
about whether to provide test solutions for all clients (Android, IOS, windows, MAC and web applications) on one
platform. Therefore, sonic client test platform was born.
#### Vision
> Sonic's vision is to help small and medium-sized enterprises solve the problem of lack of tools and testing means in
client automation or remote control. 
#### What can sonic do ?
+ Make full use of devices (24hours)
+ Remotely control your device (Android,iOS)
+ Perform UI automation tests,Stability tests and Traversal tests with devices
+ Connect CI/CD platform (Jenkins)
+ Visual report
+ And more...
